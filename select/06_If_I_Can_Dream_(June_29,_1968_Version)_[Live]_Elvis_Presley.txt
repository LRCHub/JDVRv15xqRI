There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land
Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me, why? (Why?) Oh, why? (Why?) Oh, why won't that sun appear?
Oh, why?

There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun
Where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me, why? (Why?) Oh, why? (Why?) Oh, why won't that sun appear?

We're lost in a cloud
With too much rain
We're trapped in a world
That's troubled with pain
But as long as a man
Has the strength to dream
He can redeem his soul and fly
(He can fly)

Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
Still I am sure that the answers, answers gonna come somehow
Out there in the dark (out there in the dark)
There's a beckoning candle, yeah

And while I can think, while I can talk
While I can stand, while I can walk
While I can dream, oh, please let my dream
Come true, oh, right now (if I can dream)
Let it come true right now, oh, yeah (if I can dream)
(Let it come true, right now)
