Love in a mixed up time
It's hard to know which way to go
I should never forget
Sometimes the best is left unsaid

Every one needs there a light they can follow
Sometimes the best is left unsaid
Every one needs there a light they can follow

Love is a mixed up smile
You never know which way to go
We should never forget
Every one feels their luck is going bad
Sometimes the rest is left unsaid

Every one needs there a light they can follow
Every one needs there a light they can follow

Ooh, we feel, oh, so alive going backwards
Ooh, we feel, oh, so alive going backwards
Ooh, we feel so alive going backwards
Ooh, feel so alive going backwards

You never know which way to go sometimes
It's hard to know which way to go by
You never know which way to go sometimes

We make a mess, sometimes we walk
We should never forget
Everyone feels their luck is going bad
Sometimes the best is left unsaid

Everyone needs there a light they can follow
Going backwards
Everyone needs there a light they can follow
Going backwards
Everyone needs there a light they can follow
Going backwards

Love in a mixed up time
It's hard to know ten times before
We should never forget
