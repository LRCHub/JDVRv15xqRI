```
In my mind, I'm goin' to Carolina
Can't you see the sunshine?
Can't you just feel the moonshine?
Ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind?
Yes, I'm goin' to Carolina in my mind
Karin, she's a silver sun
You best walk her away and watch it shinin'
Watch her watch the mornin' come
A silver tear appearin',
now I'm cryin', ain't I?
I'm goin' to Carolina in my-
(Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit)
