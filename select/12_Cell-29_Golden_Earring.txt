From the Album:
* Grab it for a second

He's planning a robbery
Like the common scent
5000 stories
That stand for
Yeah now he's gonna get lucky
This time he'll play it smart
By the time lucky gets lucky
This time he'll play it smart
By the time lucky gets lucky
When he steps out of the getaway car
Feeling fine rounds on cell 29
Feeling lonely in cell 29
I can't remember your face
And I face
And I face it C29
Callin' further needs
On max security
Feeling fine rounds on cell 29
I can't remember your face
And I face
And I face it C29
While I eat that food
Sleep that sleep
Miss that kiss
Feel real cheap
Swallow the pills
Forget all the thrills
No more bills
It's a crime
Cell 29
Feeling fine rounds on cell 29
Can't wait to fly out of cell 29
Miss the space and I trace Cell 29
Callin' further needs
On max security
Feeling fine around on cell 29
Feeling fine around on cell 29 cell 29
